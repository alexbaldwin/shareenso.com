Our heart is the first organ that develops in the womb.

Our heartbeat is the first vibration we feel.

Yet, somewhere along the way, we forget about our heart. 

Our heart, beating steadily, keeping us alive. 

Our heart, guiding us, giving us information.

Our heart, reminding us that we exist. 

We forget to listen.

Enso is here to help us remember. 

Enso helps us tune into our heartbeat. 

We hold Enso.

We feel the gentle pulse of our heartbeat in our palm.

We feel as our heartbeat shifts with our thoughts and moods.

It's like holding our consciousness in our palm.

We become aware of our bodies. 

We feel present. Grounded. Focused. 

We give ourselves attention and love. 

Simply by holding Enso. 

Taking a few deep breaths. 

Breathing with Enso's guiding lights.

Allowing ourselves a moment to pause and relax. 

Anytime, anywhere.

Enso is there for us. 

To comfort. To soothe. To help us.

Enso is working for us. 

Quietly. Effortlessly. Beautifully. 

Just like our hearts.
