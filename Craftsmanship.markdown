# Crafted with love 

Inspired by the soothing shape of a natural stone, Enso is crafted from sustainably harvested maple wood and hand-finished with love and care in San Francisco.

Each piece of wood is unique, and so every Enso is unique. The details have been honed with love for our earth and for our community. The result is a beautiful, timeless tool for connection with yourself and others.Â
