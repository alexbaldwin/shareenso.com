# Give yourself love
![reserve-four.jpg](/uploads/reserve-four.jpg)

Enso makes it effortless to get out of your head. It amplifies your heartbeat. You feel the gentle pulse of your heartbeat in your hand. You become aware of your heart's ever-shifting response to your mood and thoughts. You deeply reconnect with your body. 

Enso's lights glow to guide you to breathe deeply and relax. Breathing deeply is one of the most powerful relaxation tools we have, and it's available to us anytime, anywhere. But so few of us are tuned into our breathing. Take a few moments to inhale and exhale, led by Enso, and drop into a calmer and more focused state.

Whether for relaxation, meditation, or a simple check-in with yourself, Enso is there for you. 

# Hold your consciousness in your hand

Enso's colors shift with your heart rate. You see how your thoughts, attention and mood affect your body. Enso helps you build awareness of the intimate connection between mind, heart, breath and wellness. 

# Stress relief at work 

Enso helps us find calm and focus during the workday. Check in with your heart and breath during meetings or before a big presentation. Carry Enso to work in your pocket or purse, or leave it on your desk.

# Our heart matters 

Our heart is the first organ that develops in the womb. Our heartbeat is the first vibration we feel. Yet, somewhere along the way, we forget about our heart. 

Our heart, beating steadily, keeping us alive. Our heart, guiding us, giving us information. Our heart, reminding us that we exist, that we matter.

We forget to listen to our heart. Enso amplifies our heart to help us remember.
