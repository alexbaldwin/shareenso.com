    - "My first thought is to save my father's (Papa) heartbeat. I don’t see him often; he’s 74 years old as healthy-as-a-horse and a tough-as-nails cowboy. He’s not going anywhere anytime soon but I’d hate to know I could have captured the feeling of being with him when I could have and then didn’t... Papa’s a big softy and I know it will be as meaningful for him as it is for me."

I will leave mine on there for fun and then leave it for my daughter to carry on on the legacy and her own heartbeats."
