# Crafted with love

Inspired by the soothing shape of a natural stone, Enso is crafted from sustainably harvested maple wood and hand-finished with love and care in San Francisco.

Each piece of wood is unique, and so every Enso is unique. Every detail has been honed with love for our earth and for our community. The result is a beautiful, timeless tool for connection with yourself and others.

Enso's box is made made of recycled wildflower seed paper, compostable cornstarch foam and a compostable bamboo label; you can plant the box to grow wildflowers.
