# Enso is a new way to share love.

Enso allows us to capture and keep the heartbeat of someone we love, like our child, partner or aging grandparent.

Enso also allows us to share our heartbeat with loved ones near or far, live, in the moment. With Enso, we can be present in a visceral, tangible way when we're on a call with a loved one who lives thousands of miles away. 

# Wellness

People also use Enso to improve their own wellbeing and give themselves love. 

Enso helps us tune into our own heartbeat and body.

Enso guides us to breathe deeply.

Enso helps us relax and makes mindfulness feel effortless.

# Partnership program

Our referral partnership program is designed for wellness professionals: executive coaches, meditation teachers, nutritionists.

We offer our partners a sliding percentage of the $99 unit price. The percentage and payout is calculated based on the number of units sold in a quarter.

Partners can make more than $10,000 per quarter depending on their volume of referrals.

# Payouts

We offer quarterly payouts - on March 31, June 30, Sept 30, and Dec 31.

Each referral partner gets a personal promotional code so we can track referrals.
