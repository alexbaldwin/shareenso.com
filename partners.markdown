# Enso is a new way to practice self-care, mindfulness and share love.

Enso helps you tune into the gentle pulse of your own heartbeat, breathe deeply, and relax. 

Share your heartbeat with loved ones near or far to say "I love you". Capture and keep the heartbeat of someone you love - like your child, partner or grandparent - and carry them with you. 

# Partnership program

Our referral partnership program is open to top wellness professionals. Our partners care about creating a healthier, more loving world. 

We offer our partners a sliding percentage of the $99 unit price. The percentage is based on the number of units sold in a quarter through referrals. 

Our partners can make between $500 - $25,000 per quarter depending on volume of referral sales. 

# Structure

Each partner gets a personal promotional code so we can track their referrals. 

We offer quarterly payouts - on March 31, June 30, Sept 30, and Dec 31.
