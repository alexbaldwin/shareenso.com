# Enso is a new way to share love.

Enso allows us to capture and keep the heartbeat of someone we love, like our child, long-distance partner or aging grandparent.

Enso also allows us to share our heartbeat with loved ones near or far, live, in the moment.

# Wellness

People use Enso to improve their own wellbeing. Fundamentally, Enso is a tool for self-love.

It helps us tune into our own heartbeat and body.

It guides us to breathe deeply.

It helps us relax and makes mindfulness effortless.

# Partnership program

Our referral partnership program is designed for wellness professionals: executive coaches, meditation teachers, nutritionists.

We offer our partners a sliding percentage of the $99 unit price. The percentage and payout is calculated based on the number of units sold in a quarter.

Partners can make more than $25,000 per quarter depending on their volume of referrals.

We offer quarterly payouts - on March 31, June 30, Sept 30, and Dec 31.

Each referral partner gets a personal promotional code so we can track referrals.
