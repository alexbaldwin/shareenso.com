# Enso is a new way to share love.

Enso allows us to capture and keep the heartbeat of someone we love, like our child, partner or aging grandparent.

Enso also enables us to share our heartbeat with loved ones near or far, live, in the moment. 

# Self-care 

Enso is an amazing tool to improve personal wellbeing. It helps us give ourselves love. 

Enso helps us tune into our own heartbeat and body.

Enso guides us to breathe deeply.

Enso helps us relax and makes mindfulness feel effortless.

# Partnership program

Our referral partnership program is open to top wellness professionals: executive coaches, meditation teachers, fitness trainers and nutritionists.

We offer our partners a sliding percentage of the $99 unit price. The percentage and payout is calculated based on the number of units sold in a quarter.

Our partners can make between $500-$25,000 per quarter depending on volume of referrals. 

# Payouts

We offer quarterly payouts - on March 31, June 30, Sept 30, and Dec 31.

Each referral partner gets a personal promotional code so we can track referrals.
