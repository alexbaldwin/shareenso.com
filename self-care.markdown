## Hold your heart in your hand

Hold Enso in your hand. It senses your heartbeat. You feel the gentle pulse of your heartbeat in your hand, instantly reconnecting you to your body. Beautiful lights glow brighter and dimmer to guide you to breathe deeply and relax. The lights shift colors as your heart rate slows.

## Meditate with Enso 

Enso provides a point of focus while meditating, just like your breath, sound, or a candle in other practices. The visual and tactile feedback help you recognize when your mind has wandered. Enso will help get you back into your body, and it will guide you back to a place of focus and calm. 

## Relax with Enso

Regardless of whether you meditate or not, Enso is a tool for self-connection and relaxation. Feeling your heartbeat helps you notice the intimate connection between your mood, thoughts, and heart. When your heart is beating quickly, you can consciously relax. Enso's lights guide you to a slow breathing pattern called 'Box Breathing' by default. This pattern of breathing is used by the Navy Seals to relax. 

## Be Present

Our attention and awareness is one of the greatest gifts we can offer in our personal and professional relationships. Enso helps you immediately feel grounded in the present moment. It's small enough that you can carry it with you and inconspicuously hold it whenever you need to get out of your head and back into the moment. 

## Check in with yourself

With Enso, you can easily take a few moments to pause throughout your day and check in. Check in with your heart and breath during meetings or before a big presentation. Carry Enso to work in your pocket or purse, or leave it on your desk. 

## Your heart matters 

Our heart is the first organ that develops in the womb. Our heartbeat is the first vibration we feel. Yet, somewhere along the way, we forget about our heart. 

Our heart, beating steadily, keeping us alive. Our heart, guiding us, giving us information. Our heart, reminding us that we exist, that we matter.

We forget to listen to our heart. Enso amplifies our heartbeat to help us remember.
