Our heart is the first organ that develops in the womb.

Our heartbeat is the first vibration we feel.

Yet, somewhere along the way, we forget about our heart. 

Our heart, beating steadily, keeping us alive. 

Our heart, guiding us, giving us information.

Our heart, reminding us that we exist. 

We forget to listen.

Enso is here to help us remember. 

Enso helps us tune into our heartbeat. 

We hold Enso.

We feel the gentle pulse of our heartbeat in our palm.

We feel our heartbeat shift with our thoughts and moods.

Holding Enso is like holding our consciousness.

We become aware of our bodies. 

We feel present. Grounded. Focused. 

Simply by holding Enso. 

Taking a few deep breaths. 

Inhaling and exhaling with Enso's guiding lights.

Allowing ourselves a moment to relax. 

Giving ourselves attention and love. 

Anytime, anywhere.

Enso is there for us. 

To comfort. To soothe. To help us.

Enso is working for us. 

Effortlessly. Beautifully. 

Just like our hearts.
