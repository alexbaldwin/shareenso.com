# Relax with Enso 

Enso is designed to help you tune into your heartbeat, breathe deeply, and relax. 

Wherever you are, and wherever you go.

Simply take a few minutes to hold Enso. 

Focus your attention on your heartbeat. 

Breathe with Enso's guiding lights. 

Feel as your body relaxes. 

# Stress relief at work 

Carry Enso to work with you in a pocket or purse, or leave it on your desk. 

Take a moment to pause and check in throughout the day with Enso.

Use Enso to relax during meetings or before a big presentation. 

# Get grounded 

Our heart is the first organ that develops in the womb.

Our heartbeat is the first vibration we feel.

Yet, somewhere along the way, we forget about our heart. 

Our heart, beating steadily, keeping us alive. 

Our heart, guiding us, giving us information.

Our heart, reminding us that we exist, that we matter.

We forget to listen.

Enso is here to help us remember. 

# How Enso improves wellbeing 

Enso helps us tune into our heartbeat. 

We hold Enso.

We feel the gentle pulse of our heartbeat in our palm.

We feel our heartbeat shift with our thoughts and moods.

Holding Enso is like holding our consciousness.

We become aware of our bodies. 

We feel present. Grounded. Focused. 

Simply by holding Enso. 

Taking a few deep breaths. 

Inhaling and exhaling with Enso's guiding lights.

Allowing ourselves a moment to relax. 

Giving ourselves attention and love. 

# Use Enso anytime, anywhere.

Enso is there for us. 

To comfort. To soothe. To help us.

Enso is working for us. 

Quietly. Effortlessly. Beautifully. 

Just like our heart.
