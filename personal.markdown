# Give yourself love

Enso helps us tune into our heartbeat. We feel the gentle pulse of our heartbeat as we hold Enso. 

Our heartbeat shifts with our thoughts and moods. Holding Enso is like holding our consciousness.

We become aware of our bodies. We become present. Grounded. Focused. Simply by holding Enso. 

We take a few deep breaths. Inhaling and exhaling with Enso's guiding lights. Allowing ourselves a moment to relax. Giving ourselves attention and love. 

# Stress relief at work 

Use Enso to find calm and focus during the workday. Check in with your heart and breath during meetings or before a big presentation. Carry Enso to work in your pocket or purse, or leave it on your desk.

# Live in the moment 

Pause during your day. Hold Enso. Focus your attention on your heartbeat. Breathe with Enso's guiding lights. Feel as your body relaxes. 

# Our heart matters 

Our heart is our first organ that develops in the womb. Our heartbeat is the first vibration we feel. Yet, somewhere along the way, we forget about our heart. 

Our heart, beating steadily, keeping us alive. Our heart, guiding us, giving us information. Our heart, reminding us that we exist, that we matter.

We forget to listen to our heart. Enso is here to help us remember.
