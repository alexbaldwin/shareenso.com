# A new way to say "I love you" 

Our heart is the first thing that develops in the womb. Our mother's heartbeat is among the first sounds we hear. Long after we're born, many of us find deep comfort in listening to someone's heartbeat. 

We relax in a profound way when we feel the heartbeat of someone we love. Especially our significant other. That gentle pulse connects us to each other. We feel what they're feeling. We feel closer to them.  

Enso allows us to feel our partner's heartbeat from anywhere in the world.
