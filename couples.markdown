# Share love

We relax when we feel the heartbeat of someone we love. Especially our significant other. 

The gentle pulse of our heartbeat connects us. It soothes us. We feel closer. We feel like we belong.

We share love by sharing our heartbeat. 

Say "I love you" by giving your heartbeat to your partner.

# Long distance relationships  

Enso is a magical way for long-distance couples to share love. 

Enso lets us feel the energy and presence of our partner across space and time. 

Capture the heartbeat of your beloved. Carry it throughout your day.

Feel the gentle pulse of their heartbeat when you miss them. 

Share your heartbeat with each other, live, in the moment, during your nightly check-in call. 

Feel their heartbeat shift and change with their mood.

Fall asleep at night holding your love's heartbeat.

# Difficult conversations in relationships

Every relationship encounters rocky times. 

Share heartbeats when words stop working.

Use Enso to get on the same page. 

Engage when both of you have slow, steady heartbeats. 

Take time to relax when your heart rate spikes. 

Listen to your bodies. 

Proceed with care for each other's hearts.

# Mindful relationships 

Our presence and attention is one of the most valuable gifts we can offer.

Practice being present with Enso.

Hold Enso once or twice a day for a few minutes. 

Notice your heartbeat. Is it fast, or slow?

Tune into your breathing. Shallow, or deep?

Cultivate awareness without judgment. 

Carry this mindfulness with you throughout your day. 

Bring this awareness to every interaction.  

Share love from this attentive and present place.
