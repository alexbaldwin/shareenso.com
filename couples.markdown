# Share love

## Share your heartbeat with your partner to say "I love you"

We relax when we feel the heartbeat of someone we love. The gentle pulse of their heartbeat connects us. It soothes us.

We share love by sharing our heartbeat. Say "I love you" by giving your heartbeat to your partner.

# Long distance relationships

Enso allows you to capture the heartbeat of your beloved. Carry it throughout your day. Feel the gentle pulse of their heartbeat when you miss them.

Share your heartbeat with each other, live, in the moment, during your nightly check-in call. Fall asleep at night holding your love's heartbeat.

# Difficult conversations in relationships

Share your heartbeat when words feel hard. Engage when both of you have slow, steady heartbeats. Take the time to relax when your heart rate spikes.

Listen to your bodies. Use Enso to get on the same page. Proceed with care for each other's hearts.

# Mindful relationships

Practice being present with Enso. Hold Enso once or twice a day for a few minutes. Notice your heartbeat. Is it fast, or slow? Tune into your breathing. Shallow, or deep?

Cultivate awareness of how you're feeling without judgment. Carry this mindfulness with you throughout your day. Share love from this attentive and present place.
