## Hold your heart in your hand

Hold Enso in your hand. It senses your heartbeat. You feel the gentle pulse of your heartbeat in your hand, instantly reconnecting you to your body. Beautiful lights glow brighter and dimmer to guide you to breathe deeply and relax. The lights shift colors as your heart rate slows.

## Give your heartbeat to your beloved 

Enso allows you to give your heartbeat to the person you love. They will feel exactly what you're feeling in that moment. Sharing your heartbeat helps to deepen connection and intimacy. 

## Ways to share your heartbeat 

You can gift your heartbeat to your partner to say "I Love You." You may share your heartbeat with your partner to soothe them when they're feeling down. You may also choose to share your heartbeats during a challenging conversation, as a signal to both of you when it's wise to engage and when it's best to take a break. 

# Sharing in long distance relationships

Enso is a profound gift for a long-distance couple. You may share your heartbeat with each other, live, in the moment, during your daily check-in call. Fall asleep at night holding your love's heartbeat.

Enso even allows you to save and keep the heartbeat of your beloved. You can carry their love and energy with you throughout your day. Feel the gentle pulse of their heartbeat when you miss them.
