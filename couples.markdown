# Share love

We relax when we feel the heartbeat of someone we love. The gentle pulse of their heartbeat connects us. It soothes us.

We share love by sharing our heartbeat. Say "I love you" by giving your heartbeat to your partner.

# Long distance relationships  

Capture the heartbeat of your beloved. Carry it throughout your day. Feel the gentle pulse of their heartbeat when you miss them. 

Share your heartbeat with each other, live, in the moment, during your nightly check-in call. Fall asleep at night holding your love's heartbeat.

# Difficult conversations in relationships

Every relationship encounters rocky times. Share your heartbeat when words are too hard.

Engage when both of you have slow, steady heartbeats. Take the time to relax when your heart rate spikes. 

Listen to your bodies. Use Enso to get on the same page. Proceed with care for each other's hearts.

# Mindful relationships 

Practice being present with Enso.

Hold Enso once or twice a day for a few minutes. Notice your heartbeat. Is it fast, or slow? Tune into your breathing. Shallow, or deep?

Cultivate awareness of how you're feeling without judgment. Carry this mindfulness with you throughout your day. Share love from this attentive and present place.
