# A new way to say "I love you" 

Our heart is our first organ that develops in the womb. Heartbeats are the first vibrations we feel. Our mother's heartbeat is among the first sounds we hear. 

We relax when we feel the heartbeat of someone we love. Especially our significant other. That gentle pulse connects us to each other. We feel what they're feeling. We feel closer. We feel like we belong.

We share love by sharing our heartbeat. 

Say "I love you" by giving your partner your heartbeat. 

# Long distance relationships  

Enso is a magical way for long-distance couples to share love. To feel the energy and presence of your partner across space and time. 

Capture the heartbeat of your beloved and carry it with you throughout our day.

Hold their gentle heartbeat when you miss them. 

Share your heartbeat with each other, live, in the moment.

Feel each other's heartbeat shift and change with your mood.

Fall asleep at night holding the heartbeat of your partner.
