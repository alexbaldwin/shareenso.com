# A new way to say "I love you" 

We relax when we feel the heartbeat of someone we love. Especially our significant other. 

The gentle pulse of our heartbeat connects us. We feel closer. We feel like we belong.

We share love by sharing our heartbeat. 

Say "I love you" by giving your heartbeat to your partner.

# Long distance relationships  

Enso is a magical way for long-distance couples to share love. To feel the energy and presence of your partner across space and time. 

Capture the heartbeat of your beloved and carry it with you throughout your day.

Hold their gentle heartbeat when you miss them. 

Share your heartbeat with each other, live, in the moment, when you're on your nightly check-in call. 

Feel each other's heartbeat shift and change with your mood.

Fall asleep at night holding the heartbeat of your partner.
