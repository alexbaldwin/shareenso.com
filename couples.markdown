# Share love

We relax when we feel the heartbeat of someone we love. Especially our significant other. 

The gentle pulse of our heartbeat connects us. It soothes us. We feel closer. We feel like we belong.

We share love by sharing our heartbeat. 

Say "I love you" by giving your heartbeat to your partner.

# Long distance relationships  

Enso is a magical way for long-distance couples to share love. 

Enso lets us feel the energy and presence of our partner across space and time. 

Capture the heartbeat of your beloved and carry it with you throughout your day.

Hold their gentle heartbeat when you miss them. 

Share your heartbeat with each other, live, in the moment, when you're on your nightly check-in call. 

Feel each other's heartbeat shift and change with your mood.

Fall asleep at night holding the heartbeat of your partner.

# Difficult conversations in relationships

Every relationship encounters rocky times. Times when we have trouble talking with each other. 

Share your heartbeat with Enso to connect when words aren't working.

Use Enso to get on the same page. 

Engage when both of you have slow, steady heartbeats. 

Take time to breathe and relax when your heartbeat spikes. 

Listen to your bodies. 

Proceed with care for each other's hearts.

# Mindful relationships 

Our presence and attention is one of the most valuable gifts we can offer to our partner.

Practice being present with Enso.

Hold Enso once or twice a day for a few minutes. 

Notice your heartbeat. Is it fast, or slow?

Tune into your breathing. Shallow, or deep?

Notice without judgment. 

Grow your awareness of how you're feeling in the present moment.

Take a few deep breaths, expanding your belly with each inhale.

Bring your focus back to your heartbeat and breath whenever it wanders. 

After a few minutes, return to whatever you were doing. 

Carry this mindfulness with you throughout your day. 

Bring this awareness to every interaction.  

Share love from a place of attentiveness and presence.
