# A thoughtful gift 

Give your mom her grandkids' heartbeats. 

Share your heartbeat with your parents if they live far away. 

# New moms

New moms carry their baby's heartbeat to work with them after maternity leave.

They can leave their heartbeat with their baby to soothe them to sleep. 

# New dads

Fathers keep their baby's heartbeat while they travel for work. 

Keep their baby close when they return to work after paternity leave. 

# Parents

Parents can share their heartbeat with each other to share love. To connect when things get busy at home. 

They can use Enso to teach their child about their own heartbeat. How they can breathe and relax. 

# Relaxing when life gets hectic
