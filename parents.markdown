# Give your heartbeat to your child  

Offer your heartbeat to your child on their first day of school to comfort them. 

# Help your child calm down

Teach your child to relax with Enso when they start to stress about school, work and relationships.

# Stay close when your child leaves the nest

Share heartbeats with your child when they go off to college.

Feel each other's live heartbeats on your check-in calls.

# A gift for the next generation 

Gift Enso to your child as they start their own family, and the cycle begins again.
