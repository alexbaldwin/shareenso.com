# Imagine 

You capture your baby's heartbeat in their first days. 

You know how much it will mean for your husband to feel your newborn's precious heartbeat as he travels.

Your wife is returning to work after maternity leave. You save your baby's heartbeat so she can carry them to work each day. 

You give your heartbeat to your child on their first day of school to comfort them. 

You teach your child about their heartbeat and how to breathe slowly. They learn to relax and self-regulate with Enso. 

You share heartbeats with your child who's going off to college. You know it will help with homesickness. 

You gift your heartbeats to your child as they start their own family, so that your grandkids can have them someday.
