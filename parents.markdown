# Enso for families

# From their first heartbeat...

Imagine capturing your baby's heartbeat in their first days. Your partner can carry your newborn's precious heartbeat with them when they travel for work. When maternity or paternity leave ends, you can carry your baby's heartbeat with you to the office. 

# ...To their first day of school

Give your heartbeat to your child to carry with them to school. If they feel anxious or sad, they will hold your heart. With Enso, your child will keep a tangible capsule of your love and presence.

# ...During their growing pains

When your child begins to stress about school, work and relationships, Enso can help guide them to a place of calm and ease. Enso will teach your child to tune into their heartbeat, breathe, and relax.

# ... When they leave the nest

When it's time for college, you can get an Enso for your child and for yourself. With two of Enso, you'll be able to share heartbeats live, in the moment, on your check-in calls. You will feel the comfort and connection of each other's heartbeat. 

# And start their own family

As your child meets the love of their life and starts dreaming of their own family, Enso will be there for the young couple to capture your grandchildren's first heartbeats and start the cycle anew.
