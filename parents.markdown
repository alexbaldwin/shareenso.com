# A thoughtful gift 

Give your mom her grandkids' heartbeats. 

Share your heartbeat with your parents who live far away. 

# New moms

New moms can carry their baby's heartbeat to work with them after maternity leave.

# New dads

Fathers can keep their baby's heartbeat while they travel for work. 

They can keep their baby close when they return to work after paternity leave. 

# Parents

Parents can share their heartbeat with each other to share love. To connect when things get busy at home. 

# Relaxing when life gets hectic
