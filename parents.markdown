# Capture your child's first heartbeats

You capture your baby's heartbeat in their first days. 

You give your newborn's precious heartbeat to your husband to carry when he travels for work.

Your wife is returning to work after maternity leave. You save your baby's heartbeat for her. Your wife carries your child's heartbeat with her to work every day. 

# Your child is growing up 

You give your heartbeat to your child on their first day of school to comfort them. 

Your child is starting to stress about school, work and relationships. You teach them about their heartbeat and how to breathe slowly. They learn to relax with Enso. 

# Your child leaves the nest 

You share heartbeats with your child as they go off to college. You know it will help with homesickness. 

# You pass it on 

You gift your Enso to your child as they start their own family, and the cycle begins again.
