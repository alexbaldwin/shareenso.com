# From their first heartbeat...

Imagine capturing your baby's heartbeat in their first days. Your husband can carry your newborn's precious heartbeat with him when he travels for work. Your wife can carry your baby's heartbeat to work with her after maternity leave. 

# ...To their first day of school

When your child starts school, you can give your heartbeat to them. If they feel anxious or sad, they will hold your heart. With Enso, your child will carry your love and presence with them. 

# ...During their growing pains

When your child begins to stress about school, work and relationships, Enso can help guide them to a place of calm and ease. Enso will teach your child to tune into their heartbeat, breathe, and relax. 

# ... When they leave the nest

When it's time for college, you can get an Enso for your child and for yourself. With two of Enso, you'll be able to share your heartbeat with them live, in the moment, on your check-in calls. You will feel the comfort and connection of each other's heartbeat. 

# And start their own family

As your child meets the love of their life and starts dreaming of their own family, Enso will be there for the young couple to capture your grandchildren's first heartbeats and start the cycle anew.
